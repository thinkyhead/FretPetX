		<h2>Intervals</h2> <p>The table above displays the 12 intervals that
		exist within a single octave. These intervals express the
		characteristic harmonic resonance that occurs between two tones at a
		given distance. The more that the two tones compliment one another
		the more <em>consonant</em> they are said to be. The most consonant
		interval is the Perfect Fifth. (In the Major Scale a Perfect 5th
		attends every tone except VII) The more two notes interfere the more
		<em>dissonant</em> we consider them.</p>

		<h2>Harmonies and Leading</h2> <p>The dynamics of musical leading
		depend on the interplay of consonance and dissonance. When tones are
		consonant - lacking harmonic tension - they tend to leave more
		freedom of movement. Conversely, dissonant harmonies set up more
		explicit movements.</p>

		<h2>Tritones</h2>
		<p>Of the twelve intervals described above only one is its own
		reciprocal: the Diminished 5th, also called the Augmented 4th. When
		two notes a Diminished 5th apart are rung together it sets up a
		harmonic tension which is called a <em>tritone</em>. &quot;If there
		is a bright center to the Universe then this is the harmony it is
		farthest from.&quot;

		<p>In the Circle of Fifths notes that are closer together are more
		consonant and notes that are farther apart are more dissonant. The
		Diminished 5th interval extends to exact opposite sides of the
		Circle of Fifths. And it also extends diametrically across the
		Circle of Semitones, an arrangement in which tones near to one another
		are similar in tone rather than harmony.</p>

		<p>The tritone is the place where everything culminates, where there
		is no place left to go but back. But where is the tritone leading us
		back to?</p>

		<h2>A Tritone Example</h2> <p>The most familiar tritone shows up in
		the V7 chord. In the key of C this is G7. Playing the G7 chord sets
		up a tritone which wants to immediately resolve to C, which is down
		a 5th from G. In fact, the movement to the 5th below is the strongest
		leading tendency of the tritone interval.</p>

		<p>The G Dominant 7 chord has the most power to lead because it
		contains not just the tritone but <em>three other tones</em> with tendencies
		to resolve to C. So altogether there are four harmonic components
		that conjoin together to insist on a resolution to C Major:</p>

		<dl>
		<dt>The Leading Note (B)</dt>
		<dd>The 7th note of the C major scale,
		the leading note B, tends to resolve naturally to C (the tonic). B
		is the 3rd of G7, and the movement from B to C can be heard in the
		V-I resolution, when the 3rd of the dominant chord of G major (B)
		resolves to the root note of the tonic, C major.</dd>
		</dl>

		<dt>Fourth Note (F)</dt>
		<dd>The 4th (F) has a strong tendency to
		resolve harmonically. When included as a 7th in the dominant chord,
		G7, it moves to E, the 3rd of the scale and the tonic chord. Try
		playing C major with F (Csus) and move F down to E to hear how this
		movement works with the note C.</dd>

		<dt>Fifth Note (G)</dt>
		<dd>The movement B to C can be heard using a two
		note V chord. With G this resolves C major. The bass (G) moves
		naturally up a fourth (down a 5th) - G to C.</dd>

		<dt>Tritone</dd>
		<dd>The combination of F and B sets up a strong
		tension that needs to resolve. The tritone interval is the same when
		F is placed above B. Each note must still move by a semitone for
		resolution.</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2>Every Tritone Is Really Two Tritones</h2> <p>Depending on how
		you play the notes of a tritone it can have two different ways of
		resolving. F below B is an Augmented 4th tritone, the kind that
		likes to resolve to C. F above B has a tritone interval of a
		Diminished 5th, and this kind prefers to resolve to Gb/F#. In this
		case the two tones simply resolve in opposite directions. Instead of
		F-E and B-C the movement is F-F# and B-Bb.</p> <p>The resolution to
		Gb/F# can be used with F below B, and likewise the movement to C can
		be used with F over B. It all depends on the context - and your
		ear.</p>

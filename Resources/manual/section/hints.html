		<h2>When in doubt use I - IV - V</h2>

		<p>Most Western popular music is built from the basic
		I-IV-V movement. Three chord rock and roll,
		the music of Mozart, and the delta blues all rely on progressions that
		feature the first, fourth, and fifth harmonies of the major scale.</p>

		<p>The 8-bar and 12-bar blues forms demonstrate the strongest leading
		tendencies of these three scale degrees. It's hard to escape the gravity
		of these movements. Chances are good that a lot of your music will be
		attempting to escape this gravity. Sometimes gravity wins, so be
		prepared to use it anyways.</p>

		<p>Be aware also that II-V-VI,
		III-VI-VII,
		IV-VII-I ... etc., are all modal variants
		on I-IV-V. When you use these
		movements together they will tend to be associated by the listener. You
		can use the leading tendencies of these various movements to temporarily
		establish new keys. The movement used to most firmly establish a new key
		is II-IV-I (of the new key).</p>

		<h2>Resolution is easy</h2>
		<p>If you find yourself struggling to prolong a progression that seems
		to be going nowhere take a moment and see if it might not be better to
		just resolve the movement (unless resolution is not part of your master
		plan!). The most direct route to a resolution is via descending 5ths
		(counter-clockwise around The Circle), especially using dominant 7th
		chords. For example, to resolve to C you could use
		D7-G7-C.</p>

		<h2>Lock the Root</h2>
		<p>If your chords keep losing their names because you like to click in
		the Scale Box a lot then <a href="../palette/chord.html#rootlock">lock
		the root</a> to preserve your chord names. You'll be glad you did.</p>

		<h2>Keep a real guitar handy</h2>
		<p>You'll want to keep your guitar nearby when working with FretPet's
		guitar-oriented features.</p>

		<h2>Play along with FretPet all the time</h2>
		<p>FretPet has an uncommonly good sense of rhythm. The program will
		continue to play the same progression over and over again for as long as
		you want. This is ideal for practicing leads and developing
		accompaniment of all kinds. Use the program as a teacher as well as a
		tool. It is a facilitator of what you seek, a doorway to better rhythm
		and a stronger sense of movement.</p>

		<h2>Ask for help</h2>
		<p>Do you want a new feature in FretPet? Do you need help with a
		confusing topic? Would you like to report a bug? Send an email to <a
		href="mailto:support@thinkyhead.com">support@thinkyhead.com</a> to get help
		straight from the source.</p>

		<h2>A Musical Experiment</h2>
		<p>FretPet was originally conceived as a tool to build chords from
			scales, visualize chords on the guitar fretboard, calculate chord
			names, and perform chord operations like transposing keys and
			harmonizing scales. It still retains all these functions, which you
			can access without creating a document:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>See the functions of the tones in a chord</li>
			<li>Find all 12 names for any chord</li>
			<li>Find fingerings for any chord in any guitar tuning</li>
			<li>Transpose and harmonize chords interactively</li>
			<li>View chord fingering diagrams</li>
		</ul>

		<p>FretPet started out as a simple way to see how tones fit within chords,
			how tones and chords relate to different scales, and how chords
			fit into chord progressions, since chords form the framework of a
			composition in FretPet. FretPet uses the Chord Circle to show chord
			tones as a shorthand, and as a visual point of interest.</p>

		<h2>Composition</h2>
		<p>FretPet has grown from its humble beginnings into a powerful MIDI
			controller and music composition tool. You can save the chords you
			build in a progression, apply picking patterns, and play them out to
			any of your favorite synthesizers, including software synthesizers
			like <strong>GarageBand</strong>, <strong>Absynth</strong>, and many
			others. Using software like <strong>MidiPipe</strong> you can direct
			the MIDI stream and apply note filters on the way to your favorite
			synth.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Build chord progressions around keys and modes</li>
			<li>Store your favorite picking patterns</li>
			<li>Play through the QuickTime™ synthesizer and CoreMIDI</li>
			<li>Play through any hardware or software synthesizer</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Interactivity</h2>
		<p>One of my main criteria when creating FretPet was that all the visual
			elements of the program should be as interactive as possible. So
			virtually everything in FretPet can be adjusted, even during
			playback. The net result is that you can hear your compositional
			ideas evolve dynamically and make meaningful choices in real time.</p>

		<h2>Utility or Toy?</h2>
		<p>More than anything FretPet is meant to be fun and to bring an element
			of playfulness and unpredictability to the creative process. Amazing
			results come from messing around with FretPet while
			<strong>GarageBand</strong> and other synthesizer programs play and
			record your experiments. While FretPet can be very useful in
			getting to know your guitar and composing tight chord progressions,
			I've found that the best results come from taking a playful
			approach. So have fun!</p>

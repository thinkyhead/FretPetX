	@brief An abstract base class for a music output device.

	Music Devices are objects that receive tones and play them
	back in real-time. A music device may do anything with the
	notes it receives - not necessarily playing them back. The
	MidiOutput sub-class, for example, only sends the tones to
	the application's output port. The SynthOutput sub-class
	plays tones on the built-in DLS synthesizer.
